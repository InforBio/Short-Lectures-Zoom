# Why R for Biology? ![](images/R_logo.png){width=2.7cm}

## Welcome to R! {.smaller}

R is a programming language and software environment designed for statistical computing and data analysis.

::: columns
::: {.column}

Why R?

- Biologist friendly!
- Free and open-source
- Supported by a huge community

:::

::: {.column .fragment}

What you can do with R?

- Analyze your data
- Visualize your findings
- Automate your workflow
- Share reproducible research

## The R Console {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column}
![](images/r_console.png)
:::

::: {.column .incremental}
In the R console:

- **`>`** (The prompt): R is ready for your command.
Type your code and press **Enter** to run it.
- **`[1]`** (Output): This indicates the start of an output line.
- **`+`** (Continuation): R is waiting for you to finish your command.
You can either finish the command or press **Esc** to cancel it.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
In the R Console, the > prompt lets you know that R is ready for your command. Just type your code and hit Enter.
When you see the output, it will start with [1], which indicates the position of the first element.
If you see a + at the beginning of a new line, it means R is waiting for you to finish your command,
this often happens if you forget a parenthesis or a comma.
You can either finish it by typing the rest of the code or press the Esc key to cancel the input completely and get a fresh > prompt.

# Rstudio

## Rstudio Login {.smaller}

If you use the RStudio Server, you need to connect to your account first.  

![](images/rstudio_server_login.png)

(Or if you are using IFB RStudio server, connect to your IFB account and create an RStudio session.)

## Rstudio {.smaller}

Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}

::: {.column width="45%" .fragment}
1. Console: enter and execute R commands interactively.
2. Environment/History: tracks your variables and past commands.
3. Files/Plots/Packages: managing your files, viewing graphs, or installing tools.

some buttons in addition with rstudio server...
:::

## Getting Started {.smaller}

::: columns

::: {.column width="43%"}

- Open your RStudio.
- Create an R script: *File* -> *New File* -> *R Script* or click ![](images/rstudio_newfile.png){width=1.5cm}. (Will appeared at 4)
- Write your codes in the script.
- Save script: *Cmd/Ctrl + S*, name your script.
- Execute code: Click ![](images/rstudio_runcode.png){width=1.3cm} or press *Cmd/Ctrl + Enter*

:::

::: {.column width="57%"}
![](images/rstudio_fullpanel.png)
:::
:::

## Getting Started {.smaller}

Copy paste following codes into your script and save the script as `test.R`.  

- Basic codes (commands):
``` {.r code-line-numbers="1|2-4|6-8|10-12|14-15|17-18|20-21"}
# Use `#` to write a comment (line) in your script
# Math with R:
2 + 2    # Yes, R can do math!
mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) # Arithmetic mean.

# Create a variable:
x <- 5 # Now x is 5. You can reuse it!
x + 1

# Inspect your environment:
## Look at the "Environment" pane, do you see your x?
ls()

# Load a package:
library(stats)

# Get help of a function (documentation):
?mean

# Quit RStudio properly
q()
```


## Some Configuration {.smaller}

Go to *Tools* -> *Global Options...*

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Under the *General* tab:

  - Uncheck the box "Restore .RData..."
  - Set "Save workspace to .RData on exit" to **Never**.

Then click "Apply".

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Under the *Appearance* tab:

You can select a theme for you RStudio, e.g., the "Cobalt" for a dark theme.

- Under the *Pane Layout* tab:

You can arrange the four panels as you prefer.

In addition, click "Add Column" lets you open an extra "Source" code column, allowing you to view your scripts side by side!

Then click "Apply".

# A Simple Workflow

## Import Data

We'll use the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html) dataset,
which contains different measurements of three species of penguins from three islands.
(You can get the raw data [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/refs/heads/main/inst/extdata/penguins.csv){target="_blank"}.)

```{r}
# import data
penguins <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/refs/heads/main/inst/extdata/penguins.csv")

# preview the first lines
head(penguins)
```

## Summary Statistics

```{r}
# summary statistics
summary(penguins)
```

## Visualisation

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  facet_grid() +
  theme_light()
```
:::

::: {.column}
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-height: 10

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  facet_grid() +
  theme_light()
```

- Technical trainings in small groups (in English and/or in French)
  - **R for data science for the beginners** (November to January)
  - **Single cell RNAseq** (March 2026)
- 10 sessions of 3 hours with 3 in-person
- Personalized follow-up


## Take Home Messages

- R + RStudio = reproducible, flexible, free for data science
- Upcoming training IOC **R for data science** (November to January) and **single cell analysis** (March to June)!
